# Hit_Song_Prediction
Music, one of important forms of art, plays a key role in our lives. To relax themselves, people often find music from famous charts like Billboard and UK Chart. Billboard can produce more than 40 top 10 singles every year and these singles can bring money and fame to artists and its companies. Therefore, music industry really wants to find the nature of hit songs, which introduced the birth of hit song science. At the early stage of this field, some researchers think that building classification models based on machine learning algorithms can predict whether a song will become a hit, but opponents kept pointing out their modelâ€™s drawbacks. One fact that all researchers would agree with is that building a model to be used for prediction in any period is extremely hard. Therefore, this study only focuses on songs which were released within 4 years. The author aims to investigate what kinds of musical characteristics play an important role in making the audience fall in love with songs and build a model to predict if a song can be hit. The author tries to get acoustic features of songs and manually mark songs hit or not, then implement machine learning model to build a classifier based on that.
